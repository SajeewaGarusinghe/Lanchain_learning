    "# ✂️ CharacterTextSplitter - Simple Single-Separator Splitting\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is CharacterTextSplitter?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **simplest** text splitter in LangChain. It splits text based on a **single character** (or sequence).\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Differs from RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | CharacterTextSplitter | RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter |\n",
    "|---------|----------------------|-------------------------------|\n",
    "| Separators | Single (`\\n\\n` by default) | Multiple, tries in order |\n",
    "| Complexity | Simple | Smart |\n",
    "| Best for | Known structure | General text |\n",
    "| Preserves | Less semantic meaning | More semantic meaning |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Parameter | Default | Description |\n",
    "|-----------|---------|-------------|\n",
    "| `separator` | `\"\\n\\n\"` | The character(s) to split on |\n",
    "| `chunk_size` | 4000 | Maximum chunk size |\n",
    "| `chunk_overlap` | 200 | Characters shared between chunks |\n",
    "| `is_separator_regex` | `False` | Treat separator as regex |\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use? 🤔\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Use CharacterTextSplitter when:**\n",
    "- Your text has a known, consistent structure\n",
    "- You want splits at specific points (e.g., paragraphs)\n",
    "- Simplicity is preferred over semantic preservation\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Use RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter when:**\n",
    "- Text structure is unknown or varies\n",
    "- Semantic meaning preservation is important\n",
